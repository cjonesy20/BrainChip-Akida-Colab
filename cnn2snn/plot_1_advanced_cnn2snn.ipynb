        "  the symmetric quantization scheme. For instance, a 4-bit quantizer must\n",
        "  return weights on a grid of 15 values, between -7 and 7. Here, *kmax = 7*.\n",
        "- the symmetric range on which the weights will be discretized (let's say\n",

        "  scale factor. For instance with a 4-bit quantizer, the discretized weights\n",
        "  will be on the grid [*-7/sf, -6/sf, ..., -1/sf, 0, 1/sf, ..., 6/sf, 7/sf*].\n",
